I’m going to scan the workspace and Cargo manifests to see build profiles and
dependencies that impact binary size. Then I’ll summarize the main causes.

codex
Here’s what’s driving size in this workspace’s binaries.

Main Causes

- Static linking style: Each bin (codex, codex-tui, codex-exec,
codex-mcp-server, etc.) statically links its full dependency graph, so common
code isn’t shared at runtime across executables.
- Heavy deps (HTTP/TLS): reqwest brings in Hyper, HTTP/2, compressors, and a TLS
stack (rustls by default; OpenSSL on musl). In core, login, tui, and ollama you
enable reqwest with json/stream, which still pulls a large transitive set.
- Image/terminal stack: codex-tui includes image (with jpeg), ratatui,
crossterm, and ratatui-image, which together contribute significant code size
(decoders, pixel ops, terminal backends).
- Parsers/VMs: tree-sitter + tree-sitter-bash (in core and apply-patch) and
starlark (in execpolicy) include sizeable parser/VM tables and runtimes.
- Tokio runtime: Broad tokio features (rt-multi-thread, macros, process, signal)
across many crates inflate code size even if only subsets are used per bin.
- Panic + backtraces: Default panic = unwind and backtrace support keep
unwinding tables and symbols that add weight.
- Per-target OpenSSL (musl): For *-unknown-linux-musl, core enables openssl-sys
with vendored, compiling OpenSSL into the binary—this adds multiple megabytes
per executable.

Build-Mode Notes

- Release settings: You use lto = "fat" and codegen-units = 1 (good for size),
but strip = "symbols" keeps debuginfo. Debuginfo is often the largest single
contributor; if you build in release with that setting, binaries can still be
large.
- Debug builds: cargo build (dev profile) includes full debuginfo, no LTO, and
assertions—outputs are much larger than cargo build --release.

If you want, I can outline targeted trims (e.g., strip = "debuginfo", opt-level
= "z", panic abort, tighter tokio/reqwest features) and estimate impact per
binary.
